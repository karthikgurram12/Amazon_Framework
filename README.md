# Amazon_Project

All the Id's is available in the AmazonObectRepo.properties file.

The functionlities such as sign in, search, verification is divided and implemented in separate methods.

Created the required testcase in the amazon.java by using the methods implemented in AmazonImplementation java class.

For now data is such as keyword search is directly hotcoded. Need to work on this module, because of time lack, I direclty hotcoded the values.

All the jar files is not uploaded...
